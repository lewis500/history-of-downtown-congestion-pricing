\begin{abstract}

Downtown congestion pricing (DCP) is the practice of charging tolls on driving in a city's central areas as a way to relieve traffic congestion. Five major cities have implemented DCP: Singapore, London, Stockholm, Milan and Gothenburg. This paper reviews the history of DCP from the 1950's to the present-day. It describes each scheme's implementation, design, transportation impacts and finances as well as some outside historical developments. Along the way, two themes are noted: First, that exemptions from charging are highly consequential, as exempt traffic quickly grows after tolls are put in place. Second, that instituting a toll discourages much more traffic than increasing one does.
