\begin{abstract}

``Downtown congestion pricing'' (DCP) is what this paper calls the practice of charging tolls on driving in a city's central areas in such a way as to relieve traffic congestion. Five major cities have implemented DCP: Singapore, London, Stockholm, Milan and Gothenburg. Of these, Singapore and Milan have implemented two schemes. This paper reviews the history of DCP from the 1950's to the present-day, reporting on each system's implementation, design, transportation impacts and finances as well as providing some outside historical developments. Along the way, two themes recur: First, that exemptions from charging are highly consequential, as exempt traffic quickly grows after tolls are put in place. Second, that instituting a toll discourages much more traffic than increasing one does. Plans for the future are also noted.
