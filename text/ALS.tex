\section{Singapore Area License Scheme}\label{sec:als}

\subsection{Implementation}

In the early 1970's, Singapore took an interest in downtown pricing for the same reason Britain had ten years earlier: quick growth in car ownership. Between 1960 and 1970, the private vehicle population doubled as the country grew wealthier and built residential estates in its hinterlands, but the length of public roads rose only 35\% \citep{Santos2004}. Modeling from the Singapore Concept Plan of 1971 predicted the imbalance between roadspace and vehicles use would worsen, and so the government responded forcefully: in the 1970's, it consolidated the island's bus operators, built new expressways and arterials, drafted plans for a metro, imposed high taxes and fees on car ownership\footnote{See Appendix B of \citet{Gomez-Ibanez1994} for a list of Singapore's policies controlling car ownership.} and, in late 1973, convened officials from several ministries as the Road Transport Action Committee, tasked with coming up with solutions to downtown congestion. 

The Committee's first proposals included bus lanes as well as well as staggered work hours and carpooling \citep{Chin1998}. But its most historic output was a May 1974 Report \citep{SRTAC1974} which proposed four policies, all enacted: (i) increases in CBD parking fees, (ii) commuter bus services, (iii) a park-and-ride scheme, and (iv) a simple DCP system called the ``Area License Scheme'' (ALS). The inspiration for ALS seems to have come when Gabriel Roth gave the World Bank's aforementioned Caracas proposal to members of the Committee \citep{Roth2016}. ALS launched on June 3, 1975 and remained in force until 1998.

\subsection{Design}

At shops and roadside booths, drivers paid S\$3 to buy a daily ``license'' to enter a 6.2 km$^{2}$ Restricted Zone (RZ) on Monday through Saturday mornings \citep{WatsonHolland1978}. The ``license'' was a paper decal that went in a vehicle's front windshield. While the charging period was 7:30-9:30 AM originally, authorities  extended charging to 10:15 AM on August 1, 1975. Wardens standing by the road at 22 access points to the RZ wrote down the plate numbers of vehicles lacking licenses. Throughout the life of ALS, a monthly license cost twenty times the equivalent daily one. At first only private vehicles with three or fewer passengers required licenses; taxis, commercial goods vehicles, public vehicles, motorcycles, carpools and buses were exempt. But taxis lost their exempt status within three weeks of implementation due to a surge in taxi traffic within the zone. 

The government altered ALS frequently \citep{PhangToh1997}. In 1976, the price rose to S\$4 and a double rate was charged to registered company cars, because firms could deduct the charge from taxes. In 1977, charges for taxis were cut to S\$2. In 1980, the price rose to S\$5 (S\$10 for company cars). Throughout the 1980s the boundaries of the RZ were slightly expanded to encompass new real estate developments. In 1989, carpools, goods vehicles and motorcycles lost their exempt status, and an evening charging period was added from 4:30 PM to 6:30 PM. Note that the evening period was not an outbound charge, and a single license purchased travel in both periods. In January 1994, a S\$2 ``Part Day'' license was added for entry from 10:15 AM to 4:30 PM. A vehicle entering the RZ in either or both peaks needed a Whole Day license (also good between the peaks), while a driver who entered only between the peaks only needed the Part Day license. Finally, in June 1995 the government implemented the ``Road Pricing Scheme'' (RPS) consisting of tolls on one expressway, where drivers without an ALS license had to buy a cheaper RPS license to drive from 7:30-8:30 AM \citep[p. 20]{PhangToh2004}. 

\subsection{Transportation impacts}

The World Bank, interested in promoting DCP, conducted extensive studies of the scheme's original effects; the results appear as \citet{WatsonHolland1978} and are summarized, with much additional information, in \citet[Ch. 3]{Gomez-Ibanez1994}. 

Between March and October of 1975, vehicle entries to the RZ during the 7:30-10:15AM charging interval fell by 44\%---well beyond RTAC's desired 25-30\% reduction---due to a 73\% fall in entries by car. The (exempt) 4+ occupancy carpool share of traffic rose from 10\% to 44\%. Commute trips into the RZ primarily switched to bus and carpool, while travelers who had traversed the RZ in the morning to destinations outside tended to switch to a ring road. To the disappointment of authorities, a hoped-for mirror effect in the evening peak did not materialize.

In line with Theme II, Singapore government officials have cited the dramatic switch from private cars to carpool and bus as an example of \citet{Shampanier2007}'s argument, noting ``what we now know about the zero-price effect gives us some hints that standard economics is not fully accounting for the strength of motoristsâ€™ aversion to the ALS'' \citep[p.17]{Lew2009}. Moreover, despite price increases in 1976 and 1980 and the introduction of a double rate for company cars in 1976, entries during charging hours rose every year from 1975-1982, whereafter a recession sharply reduced entries \citep[pp. 17-18, Tab. 7]{Gomez-Ibanez1994}. 

Effects on speed were somewhat less dramatic than effects on entries---at least in the short run. While congestion fell within the zone, there was less effect on radial approaches and extensive additional congestion on the unpriced ring road around the RZ (see Table \ref{tab:speed-singapore}). Because of the ring road congestion, rerouting and shifting to slower modes, a survey of people's door-to-door travel times at the launch of ALS revealed a disappointing increase. The scheme looks more effective in the long run, especially after the 1989 reforms. In 1991, speeds in the morning and evening charging periods were 33 kph and 32 kph, repectively, compared to just 19 kph in 1975 \citep[p. 46]{Menon1993}. Given the country's population and economic growth from 1975-1991, this speed increase is remarkable. The 1994 introduction of the Part-Day license was also effective at curbing off-peak traffic \citep[p. 100]{PhangToh1997}, and the RPS led speed to immediately double the expressway where it was applied \citep[p. 20]{PhangToh2004}.

\subsection{Finances}

ALS was, proportionately, the most profitable DCP system. Regarding implementation costs, some sources---such as \citet{PhangToh1997})---report S\$6.6 million, but this number counts both ALS and the park-and-ride system RTAC proposed. In fact publicity and construction (e.g., large signs over the road at access points to the RZ) for ALS cost only S\$317,290 \citep[p. 38]{WatsonHolland1978}. The S\$ 6 million park-and-ride system was essentially shuttered within a few months for lack of ridership.

Initial revenues from license sales were initially S\$225,000 per month and operating costs were S\$50,000 per month. In 1992, revenues were S\$38 million and operating costs about 9 percent of revenues \citep[p. 21]{Gomez-Ibanez1994}. Just before the scheme ended ALS and RPS combined earned about S\$100 million per year \citep{Goh2002,Chin2009}.
