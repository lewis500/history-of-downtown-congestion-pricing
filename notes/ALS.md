+ fees too high: Wilson (1988), McCarthy & Tay (1993): the target was 25-30% reduction, in line w/ off-peak travel. that's too high as it is probably not efficient to have the same traffic in both peak and off -peak. but it's worse than that because the reduction was far larger. Feb 1990 measurements indicate speeds in RZ were actually higher in the peak than off-peak, w/ flows only 3/4 as high during peak as off-peak.

he exemptions in Singapore were based on the desire to avoid im-
posing any new expense on bus operators or on business and on the difficulty of reading license numbers of moving motorcycles or scooters for enforcement purposes. If

Charging three different prices for taxis, privately-owned cars,
and company cars required six easily distinguishable shapes of windshield stickers, three for monthly licenses and three for daily ones. In order to verify that company-owned cars have paid the higher fee required of them, it is necessary not only to check the shape of the windshield sticker but also to have a way of distinguishing them from privately-owned cars. For this purpose, before the scheme was implemented, all company-owned cars were assigned registration numbers prefaced with the letter "Q".

## TIMELINE

### first steps

+ from 1968-1973 the average annual rate of growth of the car fleet was 10% (RTAC 1974)
+ total length of public roads 1960-1970 increased only 35%, and length of major arterials 12%, while vehicle population doubled (Santos p. 211)
+ 1967 Government comissioned State and City Planning Study
+ 1971 study leads to publication of Singapore Concept Plan
    - high density satellite towns surrounding the CBD
    - recommended an expressway and a 20 mi rail rapid transit system 
+ 1973 all bus companies merged and nationalized (santos p. 211)
+ 1973 government convenes Road Transport Action Committee
+ 5/1974 "A plan for the relief of traffic congestion in the city" is released by RTAC

+ 1975-1980 road spending rises 6x (Willoughby p. 127)


### implmentation (everything about implementation comes from W&H 1978)
+ went into effect 6/3/1975. RZ 620 hectares 2.4 mi^2. excluded inner ring road. only cars w/ <4 persons. within 3 weeks exemption for taxis ended. S$3 S$60. originally 7:30-9:30 AM but on 8/1/1975 extended to 10:15 AM. 
+ bus service 
+ Blue Arrow express bus. air conditioned coaches, too. "Neither of the premium bus services attracted as many riders as were expected. The maximum monthly average ridership in the Air Conditioned Coaches was 150 in the morning and 100 in the evening (in August, 1975), averaging only ten persons per bus trip. In 1976, after the number of bus trips was reduced from 24 to 17, the service was used by about 130 people in the the morning and only 50 in the evening, averaging 11 passengers per bus." fares much cheaper than driving.
The" Watson & Holland p. 36
+ parking fees increased substantially.
+ park-and-ride shuttle for $S30 per month. eventually discontinued. "About six percent of the parking space was used, and the shuttle buses were so underutilized that the operators were in immediate financial difficulties. The government acted quickly to revise the shuttle bus operations, making them essentially a supplement to the regular bus service on profitable routes where more capacity was needed. Over a longer period, they found new uses for much of the car-park space." p. 15 
+ total cost S$6.6 million but only S$315k for actual ALS, rest for park-and-ride and S$45k for an adverteising campaign about staggered work hours
+ goal was to reduce inbound traffic 25-30 percent. actually ended up reducing it by 47 percent. autos and taxis w/ <4 persons declined 75% and 83% respectively. analysis suggests auto/taxi traffic shifted to carpools and buses primarily, some changed their routes and hours of travel. little effect on evening traffic.
+ speeds: averge speed increased 20% inside the zone, but there was so much extra traffic on the ring road that travel times do not appear to have changed much.


### changes
+ 1975-1988 S&GI (1994)
    - ALS fees & zone boundaries adjusted 3x
    - 1976: daily license for private cars and taxis S$4, copany cars S$8
    - 1977: S$2 taxi
    - 1980: private and company car S$5, S$10.
    - 1984,1986,1989 zone expanded to 725 ha (2.8 mi^2)
    - "the 24 percent incrase in morning peak inbound traffic remarkable small consider trends...between 1972 and 1988, # of commuters increased at least 74 percent between 1982 and 1981 and another 27 percent from 1982 to 1988. 1974-1988 $ of vehicles rose 73 percent and cars by 60 percent. 
+ 1989 reforms
    - 6/1/1989: evening licenses 4:30-6:30 pm. licenses for all vehicles but buses and emergency vehicles. carpool and truck exemptions ended. motorcycles S$1. cars reduced to S$3/S$6. dramatic reduction in traffic in evening and morning. evening entering down by 54 percent and exiting traffic by 34 percent.  average speeds within RZ rose about 20 percent to 22 mph.
