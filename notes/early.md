+ "Entirely too much discussion, by academicians and practitioners alike, has been concerned with what variousgroups " should pay " in order to com- pensate for benefits received. A ra- tional structure of prices might be in- equitable or unfair to some groups of users. But so are the prices of Cadil- lacs. The motorist who drives a new and efficient vehicle does " benefit " more from highways than does the motorist who drives the " Model A." But the latter should pay a highet price because he adds more to social cost. Until and unless heritages of the " just price " are removed from discussions of highway financing, little progress can be made." Buchanan 1952

+ The Road Space Required for Traffic in Towns (1963). Smeed taking a macroscopic view

+ Alan Walters, ‘Track Costs and Motor Taxation’, The Journal of Industrial Economics,2 (1954), 143;
	- "Nevertheless, it is clear that measures suchi as an annual licence fee for vehicles using the central areas of large towns would be a move in the right direction. For example, a special 'London licence' would have to be acquired and displayed before vehicles could use the roads of central London between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. Administration of this scheme would be easy for it would fit simply into the present licensing scheme. "

+ the idea of the buchanan report is:
	- "What were termed ‘distributor’ roads would act as corridors for traffic, distinct from rooms or ‘environmental areas’ where other human activities—living, shopping, working—would be the priority. Buchanan therefore followed the idea, originally developed in Britain by Alker Tripp, that motor traffic and pedestrians should be kept radically separate." (Gunn 2011)

+ "Buchanan had little sympathy for the notion of road pricing, perhaps because—as is so clear in his book Mixed Blessing,15 which first brought him to the notice of Ernest Marples—he believed that the motor car was a great agent of personal liberation for ordinary people, and so must have thought that taxation would threaten that freedom. The economists were equally uncomprehending that it was necessary to go to such lengths to rebuild cities in order to segregate traffic physically from people." (Hall 2004)
+ also hall: "Environmental areas" in Buchanan's report were to be pedestrianized areas, which roads would run around or under---via tunnels, below-surface highways like in Leeds or via aerial pedestrian walkways
+ "we are often told that the alternatives before us are either the reconstruction of our city centres, or else slow stagnation as more and more vehicles try to use the limited road space available. Are there no otehr possibilities?...Before pulling down the fabricof the country let us consider at least the economic implications of what we are doing." Roth (1961)
